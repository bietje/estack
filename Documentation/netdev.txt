/**
 * @defgroup netdev Network device core
 * @brief Networking (device) core for the E/STACK network stack.
 *
 * This piece of software can be viewed as as an additional (purely softwarematic) layer
 * in the OSI model, right on top of the PHY-layer. It offloads data from the PHY-drivers
 * and pushes them into the datalink layer for receiving packets. Packets that are to be
 * transmitted are pushed into the PHY-layer.
